    <h2>ABOUT COURSE</h2>
    <p>
        Information technology covers many different areas, including software solutions and hardware that allow organizations and companies to organize, gather, and evaluate data. Ultimately, the analysis of this data helps companies achieve their goals. This also includes workflow processes that can expand an organization’s capacity to grow revenue. The bottom line for many business owners in today’s fast-paced world is that revenue growth and profit margins are key drivers for performance and efficiency. There are four primary elements for information technology as a whole: information security, database and network management, computer technical support, and business software development.

        Some businesses may be under the impression that information technology is only a minor part of running the company and achieving goals. This can be a big mistake, however. The IT industry is fast-paced and always evolving with new software and hardware applications, but it must also evolve with an ever-changing workforce and workplace. For many companies, information technology is most present in their concern for network security. Network security is vital for preventing system breaches. Many various data breaches for companies large and small have made headlines in recent years, and yet a surprising number of companies still have not adapted their own systems and procedures to prevent these attacks.

    <h2>INCREDIBLE INDIA</h2>
    <p>
        India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, spanning a period of more than 4000 years, and witnessing the fusion of several customs and traditions, which are reflective of the rich culture and heritage of the Country.

        The history of the nation gives a glimpse into the magnanimity of its evolution - from a Country reeling under colonialism, to one of the leading economies in the global scenario within a span of fifty years. More than anything, the nationalistic fervour of the people is the contributing force behind the culmination of such a development. This transformation of the nation instills a sense of national pride in the heart of every Indian within the Country and abroad, and this section is a modest attempt at keeping its flame alive.
        
        I am proud to be an Indian because I have the freedom to speak, write and protest against evil doings. We have the right to stand up and fight when we see human cruelty . India is a country where people respect elders. ... India is an integrated country where people show brotherhood among others.
